# MEME ART EXHIBIT

A minimalist website crafted with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features a semi-responsive design, "semi" means that it will look medicore and some elements may be cropped on smaller screens. \
### Use of JS
JavaScript dynamically adds interactive click events to images marked with `data-enlarge`, allowing users to view images in a full-screen display.
